Question 1 :- https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/cqm-5-2/challenges/count-two

The question is simple, given that happiness count is equal to the number of integer '2' present in given array, 
so we just need to count the number of integer '2' present. 

For this, we can simply read each element one by one and if the element is equal to '2' we will increase our count.
And after reading all the element print the ans;

Note:- must initialize your counter = 0 (in my case ans = 0).
